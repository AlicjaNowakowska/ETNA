# ETNA: Extensive Tool for Network Analysis
1. This repository contains the implemntation of Graphical User Interface for network analysis. Classical measures and simulation-based ones are included. This software requieres graph-tool, numpy, pandas, random, rpy2, ipywidgets, base64, hashlib and typing libraries to be installed.

2. There are **three** methods of running ETNA: 
    * usual Python interpreter - download ETNA_source_code.py file, compile and type in the interpreter:

      G = GUI_for_network_analysis()

      G.bind()

      G.display()

    * .ipynb interpreter (Jupyter Notebook) - download ETNAYourOwnJupyterInterpreter.ipynb, open the file using Jupyter Notebook interpreter and run each cell.
    * online .ipynb interpreter (Colab) - Go to https://githubtocolab.com/AlicjaNowakowska/ETNA/blob/main/ETNAColab.ipynb and run each cell by clicking Shift + Enter buttons or download the file ETNAColab.ipynb on your computer, upload it to your Google Drive, open the file using Colab and run each cell by clicking Shift + Enter buttons. 

3. There are 4 network datasets served as exemplary ones. They can be found in the folder ExemplaryData.zip
