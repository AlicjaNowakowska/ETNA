# ETNA: Extensive Tool for Network Analysis
1. This repository contains the implemntation of a graphical user interface for network analysis. Classical measures and simulation-based ones are included. This software requieres graph-tool, numpy, pandas, random, rpy2, ipywidgets, base64, hashlib and typing libraries to be installed in your working environment.

2. There are **three** methods of running ETNA: 
    * .ipynb interpreter (Jupyter Notebook) - download ETNAYourOwnJupyterInterpreter.ipynb, open the file using Jupyter Notebook interpreter and run each cell.
    * download ETNA_source_code2.py and in a jupyter notebook type in the cell %run -i  ETNA_source_code2.py an run it.
    * online .ipynb interpreter (Colab) - Go to https://githubtocolab.com/AlicjaNowakowska/ETNA/blob/main/ETNAColab.ipynb and run each cell by clicking Shift + Enter buttons or download the file ETNAColab.ipynb on your computer, upload it to your Google Drive, open the file using Colab and run each cell by clicking Shift + Enter buttons. 
  
3. There are 4 network datasets served as exemplary ones. They can be found in the folder ExemplaryData.zip
