# GUIForNetworkAnalysis
1. This repository contains the implemntation of Graphical User Interface for NetworksAnalysis. It requieres graph-tool, numpy, pandas, random, rpy2, ipywidgets, base64, hashlib and typing libraries to be installed.

2. There are **three** methods of running GUI: 
    * usual Python interpreter - download GUI_source_code.py file, compile and type in the interpreter:

      G = GUI_for_network_analysis()

      G.bind()

      G.display()

    * .ipynb interpreter (Jupyter Notebook) - download GUIForNetworkAnalysisYourOwnJupyterInterpreter.ipynb and run each cell.
    * online .ipynb interpreter (Colab) - download GUIForNetworkAnalysisColab.ipynb, run it in Colab and run each cell.

3. There are 4 network datasets served as exemplary ones. They can be found in the folder ExemplaryData.zip
